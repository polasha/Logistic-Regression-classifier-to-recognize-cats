# Assignment-1: Logistic-Regression-with-a-Neural-Network-mindset (course: Neural network and deep learning from coursera)
Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including: 
Initializing parameters Calculating the cost function and 
its gradient Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) 
Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
